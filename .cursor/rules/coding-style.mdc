## HTML
- Use 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs).
- Use semantic HTML tags (e.g., <header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>) where appropriate.
- Use lowercase for all tag and attribute names.
- Use double quotes for attribute values.
- Close all tags, including self-closing tags (e.g., <img />, <br />).
- Add comments to explain complex or non-obvious structures.

## CSS
- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Use class selectors for styling (avoid IDs for styling purposes).
- Use lowercase and hyphen-separated (kebab-case) class names (e.g., .main-section).
- Group related styles together and use comments to separate sections.
- Place media queries at the end of the file or section.
- Prefer shorthand properties where possible (e.g., margin: 0 8px;).

## JavaScript
- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Use camelCase for variable and function names.
- Use const and let instead of var.
- Prefer arrow functions for callbacks and short functions.
- Add comments to explain complex logic or important sections.
